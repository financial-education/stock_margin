When an investor buys or shorts a stock on margin, they are using money from their broker.  Simply stated:

- Buying stock on margin means the investor receives a loan from their broker, with the stock as collateral.
- Shorting stock on margin means the investor receives a loan from their broker, with the cash proceeds from the short as collateral.
